# Skew 
Skew is a Rust script whose purpose is to provide its users with a simple, precise and highly effective tool for atmospheric properties calculation on the server side of the operation.

## :memo: Usage

## :gear: Features
- Geometric to geopotential altittude conversion will be performed in every calculation automatically
- 

## :warning: Limitations
- The results will be presented in aproximated format only with as many significant figures as the author think are correct according to their experience in the field.
- The calculation methods are valid for Air as ideal gas with a temperature range of [273.15 - 1800]K

## :world_map: Roadmap
Some options to implement as flags indications:
- [ ] Not aproximated results
- [ ] Print on screen the atmosphere layer of flight
- [ ] Present the results on Imperial Unit System

## :building_construction: Dependencies
